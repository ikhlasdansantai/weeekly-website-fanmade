## ðŸšª About / project background
A side project during Ramadan, because I'm a fan of this idol group and they don't have an official website yet. So, I decided to create one as a learning and practice opportunity, although it's quite challenging since I'm still learning how to use ReactJS. That's all for now, sorry for the lengthy message :V
